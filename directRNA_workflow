# This document will introduce the analysis pipeline of direct RNA-Seq data generated from MinION Nanopore sequencing. The raw data format is fast5 file which contains 4000 reads in each of them.

# base calling, fast5 to fastq 
## All about guppy
The current state-of-the-art basecaller, current ONT official nerual network based basecaller, translating the electronic raw signal of sequencer into bases, e.g, ATCG..
Besides base calling, it can also filter low quality reads, clipping ONT adaptors, and calculate methylation probablities per base.


## use config file (-c ) to input parameters for guppy
guppy_basecaller –i ./fast5 –s ./guppy_out –c rna_r9.4.1_10kbps_direct.cfg --num_callers 2 --cpu_threads_per_caller 1
## or use -f (flow cell type) -k (which kit used)
guppy_basecaller –i ./fast5 –s ./guppy_out –f FLO-MIN106 -k SQK-RNA002 --num_callers 2 --cpu_threads_per_caller 1
## combine all fastq files in guppy_out together for the following analysis
cat *.fastq > all_guppy.fastq
